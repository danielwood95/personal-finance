## Does it really matter if you start saving this year? 

It's easy to underestimate the power of saving money early and consistently. However, it's also overwhelming choosing how to invest your money. I created these personal finance models to understand the different outcomes depending on when, how, and where I put my money. 

## Questions I wanted to answer: 
* What plays a bigger factor in your overall return? 
  * How long you invest
  * How much you invest
  * Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR)
  * Variance in AAGR
* Where should I invest my savings?
  * 401k 
  * Roth 401k
  * Brokerage account
